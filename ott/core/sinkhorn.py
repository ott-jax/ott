  A Sinkhorn solver takes a linear OT problem object as an input and returns a
  SinkhornOutput object that contains all the information required to compute
  transports. See :func:`~ott.core.sinkhorn.sinkhorn` for a functional wrapper.

  Args:
    lse_mode: ``True`` for log-sum-exp computations, ``False`` for kernel
      multiplication.
    threshold: tolerance used to stop the Sinkhorn iterations. This is
      typically the deviation between a target marginal and the marginal of the
      current primal solution when either or both tau_a and tau_b are 1.0
      (balanced or semi-balanced problem), or the relative change between two
      successive solutions in the unbalanced case.
    norm_error: power used to define p-norm of error for marginal/target.
    inner_iterations: the Sinkhorn error is not recomputed at each
      iteration but every inner_num_iter instead.
    min_iterations: the minimum number of Sinkhorn iterations carried
      out before the error is computed and monitored.
    max_iterations: the maximum number of Sinkhorn iterations. If
      ``max_iterations`` is equal to ``min_iterations``, sinkhorn iterations are
      run by default using a :func:`jax.lax.scan` loop rather than a custom,
      unroll-able :func:`jax.lax.while_loop` that monitors convergence.
      In that case the error is not monitored and the ``converged``
      flag will return ``False`` as a consequence.
    momentum: a Momentum instance. See ott.core.momentum
    anderson: an AndersonAcceleration instance. See ott.core.anderson.
    implicit_diff: instance used to solve implicit differentiation. Unrolls
      iterations if None.
    parallel_dual_updates: updates potentials or scalings in parallel if True,
      sequentially (in Gauss-Seidel fashion) if False.
    use_danskin: when ``True``, it is assumed the entropy regularized cost is
      is evaluated using optimal potentials that are frozen, i.e. whose
      gradients have been stopped. This is useful when carrying out first order
      differentiation, and is only valid (as with ``implicit_differentiation``)
      when the algorithm has converged with a low tolerance.
    jit: if True, automatically jits the function upon first call.
      Should be set to False when used in a function that is jitted by the user,
      or when computing gradients (in which case the gradient function
      should be jitted by the user)
    initializer: how to compute the initial potentials/scalings.

  r"""Solve regularized OT problem using Sinkhorn iterations.

  The Sinkhorn algorithm is a fixed point iteration that solves a regularized
  optimal transport (reg-OT) problem between two measures.
  The optimization variables are a pair of vectors (called potentials, or
  scalings when parameterized as exponentials of the former). Calling this
  function returns therefore a pair of optimal vectors. In addition to these,
  it also returns the objective value achieved by these optimal vectors;
  a vector of size ``max_iterations/inner_iterations`` that records the vector
  of values recorded to monitor convergence, throughout the execution of the
  algorithm (padded with `-1` if convergence happens before), as well as a
  boolean to signify whether the algorithm has converged within the number of
  iterations specified by the user.

  The reg-OT problem is specified by two measures, of respective sizes ``n`` and
  ``m``. From the viewpoint of the ``sinkhorn`` function, these two measures are
  only seen through a triplet (``geom``, ``a``, ``b``), where ``geom`` is a
  ``Geometry`` object, and ``a`` and ``b`` are weight vectors of respective
  sizes ``n`` and ``m``. Starting from two initial values for those potentials
  or scalings (both can be defined by the user by passing value in
  ``init_dual_a`` or ``init_dual_b``), the Sinkhorn algorithm will use
  elementary operations that are carried out by the ``geom`` object.

  Some maths:
    Given a geometry ``geom``, which provides a cost matrix :math:`C` with its
    regularization parameter :math:`\varepsilon`, (or a kernel matrix :math:`K`)
    the reg-OT problem consists in finding two vectors `f`, `g` of size ``n``,
    ``m`` that maximize the following criterion.

    .. math::

      \arg\max_{f, g}{- \langle a, \phi_a^{*}(-f) \rangle -  \langle b,
      \phi_b^{*}(-g) \rangle - \varepsilon \langle e^{f/\varepsilon},
      e^{-C/\varepsilon} e^{-g/\varepsilon}} \rangle

    where :math:`\phi_a(z) = \rho_a z(\log z - 1)` is a scaled entropy, and
    :math:`\phi_a^{*}(z) = \rho_a e^{z/\varepsilon}`, its Legendre transform.

    That problem can also be written, instead, using positive scaling vectors
    `u`, `v` of size ``n``, ``m``, handled with the kernel
    :math:`K := e^{-C/\varepsilon}`,

    .. math::

      \arg\max_{u, v >0} - \langle a,\phi_a^{*}(-\varepsilon\log u) \rangle +
      \langle b, \phi_b^{*}(-\varepsilon\log v) \rangle - \langle u, K v \rangle

    Both of these problems corresponds, in their *primal* formulation, to
    solving the unbalanced optimal transport problem with a variable matrix
    :math:`P` of size ``n`` x ``m``:

    .. math::

      \arg\min_{P>0} \langle P,C \rangle -\varepsilon \text{KL}(P | ab^T)
      + \rho_a \text{KL}(P\mathbf{1}_m | a) + \rho_b \text{KL}(P^T \mathbf{1}_n
      | b)

    where :math:`KL` is the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence.

    The very same primal problem can also be written using a kernel :math:`K`
    instead of a cost :math:`C` as well:

    .. math::

      \arg\min_{P} \varepsilon KL(P|K) + \rho_a \text{KL}(P\mathbf{1}_m | a) +
      \rho_b \text{KL}(P^T \mathbf{1}_n | b)

    The *original* OT problem taught in linear programming courses is recovered
    by using the formulation above relying on the cost :math:`C`, and letting
    :math:`\varepsilon \rightarrow 0`, and :math:`\rho_a, \rho_b \rightarrow
    \infty`.
    In that case the entropy disappears, whereas the :math:`KL` regularization
    above become constraints on the marginals of :math:`P`: This results in a
    standard min cost flow problem. This problem is not handled for now in this
    toolbox, which focuses exclusively on the case :math:`\varepsilon > 0`.

    The *balanced* regularized OT problem is recovered for finite
    :math:`\varepsilon > 0` but letting :math:`\rho_a, \rho_b \rightarrow
    \infty`. This problem can be shown to be equivalent to a matrix scaling
    problem, which can be solved using the Sinkhorn fixed-point algorithm.
    To handle the case :math:`\rho_a, \rho_b \rightarrow \infty`, the
    ``sinkhorn`` function uses parameters :math:`tau\_a := \rho_a /
    (\varepsilon + \rho_a)` and :math:`tau\_b := \rho_b / (\varepsilon +
    \rho_b)` instead. Setting either of these parameters to 1 corresponds to
    setting the corresponding :math:`\rho_a, \rho_b` to :math:`\infty`.

    The Sinkhorn algorithm solves the reg-OT problem by seeking optimal `f`, `g`
    potentials (or alternatively their parametrization as positive scalings
    `u`, `v`), rather than solving the primal problem in :math:`P`.
    This is mostly for efficiency (potentials and scalings have a ``n + m``
    memory footprint, rather than ``n m`` required to store `P`). This is also
    because both problems are, in fact, equivalent, since the optimal transport
    math:`P^*` can be recovered from optimal potentials :math:`f^*`, :math:`g^*`
    or scalings :math:`u^*`, :math:`v^*`, using the geometry's cost or kernel
    matrix respectively:

    .. math::

      P^* = \exp\left(\frac{f^*\mathbf{1}_m^T + \mathbf{1}_n g^{*T} -
      C}{\varepsilon}\right) \text{ or } P^* = \text{diag}(u^*) K
      \text{diag}(v^*)

    By default, the Sinkhorn algorithm solves this dual problem in `f, g` or
    `u, v` using block coordinate ascent, i.e. devising an update for each `f`
    and `g` (resp. `u` and `v`) that cancels their respective gradients, one at
    a time. These two iterations are repeated ``inner_iterations`` times, after
    which the norm of these gradients will be evaluated and compared with the
    ``threshold`` value. The iterations are then repeated as long as that error
    exceeds ``threshold``.

  Note on Sinkhorn updates:
    The boolean flag ``lse_mode`` sets whether the algorithm is run in either:

    - log-sum-exp mode (``lse_mode=True``), in which case it is directly
      defined in terms of updates to `f` and `g`, using log-sum-exp
      computations. This requires access to the cost matrix :math:`C`, as it is
      stored, or possibly computed on the fly by ``geom``.

    - kernel mode (``lse_mode=False``), in which case it will require access
      to a matrix vector multiplication operator :math:`z \rightarrow K z`,
      where :math:`K` is either instantiated from :math:`C` as
      :math:`\exp(-C/\varepsilon)`, or provided directly. In that case, rather
      than optimizing on :math:`f` and :math:`g`, it is more convenient to
      optimize on their so called scaling formulations,
      :math:`u := \exp(f / \varepsilon)` and :math:`v := \exp(g / \varepsilon)`.
      While faster (applying matrices is faster than applying ``lse`` repeatedly
      over lines), this mode is also less stable numerically, notably for
      smaller :math:`\varepsilon`.

    In the source code, the variables ``f_u`` or ``g_v`` can be either regarded
    as potentials (real) or scalings (positive) vectors, depending on the choice
    of ``lse_mode`` by the user. Once optimization is carried out, we only
    return dual variables in potential form, i.e. ``f`` and ``g``.

    In addition to standard Sinkhorn updates, the user can also use heavy-ball
    type updates using a ``momentum`` parameter in ]0,2[. We also implement a
    strategy that tries to set that parameter adaptively at
    ``chg_momentum_from`` iterations, as a function of progress in the error,
    as proposed in the literature.

    Another upgrade to the standard Sinkhorn updates provided to the users lies
    in using Anderson acceleration. This can be parameterized by setting the
    otherwise null ``anderson`` to a positive integer. When selected,the
    algorithm will recompute, every ``refresh_anderson_frequency`` (set by
    default to 1) an extrapolation of the most recently computed ``anderson``
    iterates. When using that option, notice that differentiation (if required)
    can only be carried out using implicit differentiation, and that all
    momentum related parameters are ignored.

    The ``parallel_dual_updates`` flag is set to ``False`` by default. In that
    setting, ``g_v`` is first updated using the latest values for ``f_u`` and
    ``g_v``, before proceeding to update ``f_u`` using that new value for
    ``g_v``. When the flag is set to ``True``, both ``f_u`` and ``g_v`` are
    updated simultaneously. Note that setting that choice to ``True`` requires
    using some form of averaging (e.g. ``momentum=0.5``). Without this, and on
    its own ``parallel_dual_updates`` won't work.

  Differentiation:
    The optimal solutions ``f`` and ``g`` and the optimal objective
    (``reg_ot_cost``) outputted by the Sinkhorn algorithm can be differentiated
    w.r.t. relevant inputs ``geom``, ``a`` and ``b`` using, by default, implicit
    differentiation of the optimality conditions (``implicit_differentiation``
    set to ``True``). This choice has two consequences.

    - The termination criterion used to stop Sinkhorn (cancellation of
      gradient of objective w.r.t. ``f_u`` and ``g_v``) is used to differentiate
      ``f`` and ``g``, given a change in the inputs. These changes are computed
      by solving a linear system. The arguments starting with
      ``implicit_solver_*`` allow to define the linear solver that is used, and
      to control for two types or regularization (we have observed that,
      depending on the architecture, linear solves may require higher ridge
      parameters to remain stable). The optimality conditions in Sinkhorn can be
      analyzed as satisfying a ``z=z'`` condition, which are then
      differentiated. It might be beneficial (e.g., as in :cite:`cuturi:20a`)
      to use a preconditioning function ``precondition_fun`` to differentiate
      instead ``h(z) = h(z')``.

    - The objective ``reg_ot_cost`` returned by Sinkhorn uses the so-called
      envelope (or Danskin's) theorem. In that case, because it is assumed that
      the gradients of the dual variables ``f_u`` and ``g_v`` w.r.t. dual
      objective are zero (reflecting the fact that they are optimal), small
      variations in ``f_u`` and ``g_v`` due to changes in inputs (such as
      ``geom``, ``a`` and ``b``) are considered negligible. As a result,
      ``stop_gradient`` is applied on dual variables ``f_u`` and ``g_v`` when
      evaluating the ``reg_ot_cost`` objective. Note that this approach is
      `invalid` when computing higher order derivatives. In that case the
      ``use_danskin`` flag must be set to ``False``.

    An alternative yet more costly way to differentiate the outputs of the
    Sinkhorn iterations is to use unrolling, i.e. reverse mode differentiation
    of the Sinkhorn loop. This is possible because Sinkhorn iterations are
    wrapped in a custom fixed point iteration loop, defined in
    ``fixed_point_loop``, rather than a standard while loop. This is to ensure
    the end result of this fixed point loop can also be differentiated, if
    needed, using standard JAX operations. To ensure backprop differentiability,
    the ``fixed_point_loop.fixpoint_iter_backprop`` loop does checkpointing of
    state variables (here ``f_u`` and ``g_v``) every ``inner_iterations``, and
    backpropagates automatically, block by block, through blocks of
    ``inner_iterations`` at a time.

  Note:
    * The Sinkhorn algorithm may not converge within the maximum number of
      iterations for possibly several reasons:

      1. the regularizer (defined as ``epsilon`` in the geometry ``geom``
         object) is too small. Consider either switching to ``lse_mode=True``
         (at the price of a slower execution), increasing ``epsilon``, or,
         alternatively, if you are unable or unwilling to increase  ``epsilon``,
         either increase ``max_iterations`` or ``threshold``.
      2. the probability weights ``a`` and ``b`` do not have the same total
         mass, while using a balanced (``tau_a=tau_b=1.0``) setup.
         Consider either normalizing ``a`` and ``b``, or set either ``tau_a``
         and/or ``tau_b<1.0``.
      3. OOMs issues may arise when storing either cost or kernel matrices that
         are too large in ``geom``. In the case where, the ``geom`` geometry is
         a ``PointCloud``, some of these issues might be solved by setting the
         ``online`` flag to ``True``. This will trigger a re-computation on the
         fly of the cost/kernel matrix.

    * The weight vectors ``a`` and ``b`` can be passed on with coordinates that
      have zero weight. This is then handled by relying on simple arithmetic for
      ``inf`` values that will likely arise (due to :math:`\log 0` when
      ``lse_mode`` is ``True``, or divisions by zero when ``lse_mode`` is
      ``False``). Whenever that arithmetic is likely to produce ``NaN`` values
      (due to ``-inf * 0``, or ``-inf - -inf``) in the forward pass, we use
      ``jnp.where`` conditional statements to carry ``inf`` rather than ``NaN``
      values. In the reverse mode differentiation, the inputs corresponding to
      these 0 weights (a location `x`, or a row in the corresponding cost/kernel
      matrix), and the weight itself will have ``NaN`` gradient values. This is
      reflects that these gradients are undefined, since these points were not
      considered in the optimization and have therefore no impact on the output.

  Args:
    geom: a Geometry object.
    a: The first marginal. If `None`, it will be uniform.
    b: The second marginal. If `None`, it will be uniform.
    tau_a: ratio rho/(rho+eps) between KL divergence regularizer to first
     marginal and itself + epsilon regularizer used in the unbalanced
     formulation.
    tau_b: ratio rho/(rho+eps) between KL divergence regularizer to first
     marginal and itself + epsilon regularizer used in the unbalanced
     formulation.
    init_dual_a: optional initialization for potentials/scalings w.r.t.
      first marginal (``a``) of reg-OT problem.
    init_dual_b: optional initialization for potentials/scalings w.r.t.
      second marginal (``b``) of reg-OT problem.
    threshold: tolerance used to stop the Sinkhorn iterations. This is
      typically the deviation between a target marginal and the marginal of the
      current primal solution when either or both tau_a and tau_b are 1.0
      (balanced or semi-balanced problem), or the relative change between two
      successive solutions in the unbalanced case.
    norm_error:
      power used to define p-norm of error for marginal/target.
    inner_iterations:the Sinkhorn error is not recomputed at each
      iteration but every inner_num_iter instead.
    min_iterations: the minimum number of Sinkhorn iterations carried
      out before the error is computed and monitored.
    max_iterations: the maximum number of Sinkhorn iterations. If
      ``max_iterations`` is equal to ``min_iterations``, sinkhorn iterations are
      run by default using a :func:`jax.lax.scan` loop rather than a custom,
      unroll-able :func:`jax.lax.while_loop` that monitors convergence.
      In that case, the error is not monitored and the ``converged`` flag
      will return ``False`` as a consequence.
    momentum:
      a float in [0,2].
    chg_momentum_from: if positive, momentum is recomputed using the
      adaptive rule provided in :cite:`lehmann:21`
      after that number of iterations.
    anderson_acceleration: int, if 0 (default), no acceleration. If positive,
      use Anderson acceleration on the dual sinkhorn (in log/potential form), as
      described `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_acceleration>`_
      and advocated in :cite:`chizat:20`, with a memory of size equal
      to ``anderson_acceleration``. In that case, differentiation is
      necessarily handled implicitly (``implicit_differentiation`` is set to
      ``True``) and all ``momentum`` related parameters are ignored.
    refresh_anderson_frequency: int, when using ``anderson_acceleration``,
      recompute direction periodically every int sinkhorn iterations.
    lse_mode: ``True`` for log-sum-exp computations, ``False`` for kernel
      multiplication.
    implicit_differentiation: ``True`` if using implicit differentiation,
      ``False`` if unrolling Sinkhorn iterations.
    linear_solve_kwargs: parametrization of linear solver when using implicit
      differentiation. Arguments currently accepted appear in the optional
      arguments of ``apply_inv_hessian``, namely ``linear_solver_fun``,  a
      Callable that specifies the linear solver, as well as ``ridge_kernel`` and
      ``ridge_identity``, to be added to enforce stability of linear solve.
    parallel_dual_updates: updates potentials or scalings in parallel if True,
      sequentially (in Gauss-Seidel fashion) if False.
    use_danskin: when ``True``, it is assumed the entropy regularized cost is
      is evaluated using optimal potentials that are frozen, i.e. whose
      gradients have been stopped. This is useful when carrying out first order
      differentiation, and is only valid (as with ``implicit_differentiation``)
      when the algorithm has converged with a low tolerance.
    jit: if True, automatically jits the function upon first call.
      Should be set to False when used in a function that is jitted by the user,
      or when computing gradients (in which case the gradient function
      should be jitted by the user).
    kwargs: Additional keyword arguments (see above).

  Returns:
    a ``SinkhornOutput`` named tuple. The tuple contains two optimal potential
    vectors ``f`` and ``g``, the objective ``reg_ot_cost`` evaluated at those
    solutions, an array of ``errors`` to monitor convergence every
    ``inner_iterations`` and a flag ``converged`` that is ``True`` if the
    algorithm has converged within the number of iterations that was predefined
    by the user.
