  r"""Soft quantizes an input according using ``num_levels`` values along axis.

  The quantization operator consists in concentrating several values around
  a few predefined ``num_levels``. The soft quantization operator proposed here
  does so by carrying out a `soft` concentration that is differentiable. The
  ``inputs`` values are first soft-sorted, resulting in ``num_levels`` values.
  In a second step, the ``inputs`` values are then provided again a composite
  value that is equal (for each) to a convex combination of those soft-sorted
  values using the transportation matrix. As the regularization parameter
  ``epsilon`` of regularized optimal transport goes to 0, this operator recovers
  the expected behavior of quantization, namely each value in ``inputs`` is
  assigned a single level. When using ``epsilon>0`` the behavior is similar but
  differentiable.

  Args:
    inputs: an Array of size [batch, dim].
    num_levels: number of quantiles available to quantize the signal.
    axis: axis along which quantization is carried out.
    kwargs: keyword arguments passed on to lower level functions. Of interest
      to the user are ``squashing_fun``, which will redistribute the values in
      ``inputs`` to lie in :math:`[0,1]` (sigmoid of whitened values by default)
      to solve the optimal transport problem;
      :class:`cost_fn <ott.geometry.costs.CostFn>` object of
      :class:`~ott.geometry.pointcloud.PointCloud`, which defines the ground
      1D cost function to transport from ``inputs`` to the ``num_targets``
      target values; ``epsilon`` regularization parameter. Remaining ``kwargs``
      are passed on to parameterize the
      :class:`~ott.solvers.linear.sinkhorn.Sinkhorn` solver.

  Returns:
    An Array of the same size as ``inputs``.
