  """Compute sinkhorn divergence between subsets of vectors given in `x` & `y`.

  Helper function designed to compute Sinkhorn divergences between several point
  clouds of varying size, in parallel, using padding for efficiency.
  In practice, The inputs `x` and `y` (and their weight vectors `weights_x` and
  `weights_y`) are assumed to be large weighted point clouds, that describe
  points taken from multiple measures. To extract several subsets of points, we
  provide two interfaces. The first interface assumes that a vector of id's is
  passed, describing for each point of `x` (resp. `y`) to which measure the
  point belongs to. The second interface assumes that `x` and `y` were simply
  formed by concatenating several measures contiguously, and that only indices
  that segment these groups are needed to recover them.

  For both interfaces, both `x` and `y` should contain the same total number of
  segments. Each segment will be padded as necessary, all segments rearranged as
  a tensor, and `vmap` used to evaluate sinkhorn divergences in parallel.

  Args:
    x: Array of input points, of shape `[num_x, feature]`.
      Multiple segments are held in this single array.
    y: Array of target points, of shape `[num_y, feature]`.
    num_segments: Number of segments contained in `x` and `y`.
      Providing this is required for JIT compilation to work,
      see also :func:`~ott.geometry.segment.segment_point_cloud`.
    max_measure_size: Total size of measures after padding. Should ideally be
      set to an upper bound on points clouds processed with the segment
      interface. Should also be smaller than total length of `x` or `y`.
      Providing this is required for JIT compilation to work.
    cost_fn: Cost function,
      defaults to :class:`~ott.geometry.costs.SqEuclidean`.
    segment_ids_x: **1st interface** The segment ID for which each row of `x`
      belongs. This is a similar interface to :func:`jax.ops.segment_sum`.
    segment_ids_y: **1st interface** The segment ID for which each row of `y`
      belongs.
    indices_are_sorted: **1st interface** Whether `segment_ids_x` and
      `segment_ids_y` are sorted.
    num_per_segment_x: **2nd interface** Number of points in each segment in
      `x`. For example, [100, 20, 30] would imply that `x` is segmented into
      three arrays of length `[100]`, `[20]`, and `[30]` respectively.
    num_per_segment_y: **2nd interface** Number of points in each segment in
      `y`.
    weights_x: Weights of each input points, arranged in the same segmented
      order as `x`.
    weights_y: Weights of each input points, arranged in the same segmented
      order as `y`.
    sinkhorn_kwargs: Optionally a dict containing the keywords arguments for
      calls to the `sinkhorn` function, called three times to evaluate for each
      segment the sinkhorn regularized OT cost between `x`/`y`, `x`/`x`, and
      `y`/`y` (except when `static_b` is `True`, in which case `y`/`y` is not
      evaluated)
    static_b: if True, divergence of measure b against itself is NOT computed
    share_epsilon: if True, enforces that the same epsilon regularizer is shared
      for all 2 or 3 terms of the Sinkhorn divergence. In that case, the epsilon
      will be by default that used when comparing x to y (contained in the first
      geometry). This flag is set to True by default, because in the default
      setting, the epsilon regularization is a function of the mean of the cost
      matrix.
    symmetric_sinkhorn: Use Sinkhorn updates in Eq. 25 of :cite:`feydy:19` for
      symmetric terms comparing x/x and y/y.
    kwargs: keywords arguments passed to form
      :class:`~ott.geometry.pointcloud.PointCloud` geometry objects from the
      subsets of points and masses selected in `x` and `y`, this could be for
      instance entropy regularization float, scheduler or normalization.
