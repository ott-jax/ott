  """Implicit differentiation of Sinkhorn algorithm.

  Args:
    solver: Callable to compute the solution to a linear problem. The callable
      expects a linear function, a vector, optionally another linear function
      that implements the transpose of that function, and a boolean flag to
      specify symmetry. This solver is by default one of :class:`lineax.CG` or
      :class:`lineax.NormalCG` solvers, if the package can be imported, as
      described in :func:`~ott.solvers.linear.lineax_implicit.solve_lineax`.
      The :mod:`jax` alternative is described in
      :func:`~ott.solvers.linear.implicit_differentiation.solve_jax_cg`.
      Note that `lineax` solvers handle better poorly conditioned problems,
      which arise typically when differentiating the solutions of balanced OT
      problems (when ``tau_a==tau_b==1.0``). Relying on
      :func:`~ott.solvers.linear.implicit_differentiation.solve_jax_cg`
      for such cases might require hand-tuning ridge parameters,
      in particular ``ridge_kernel`` and ``ridge_identity`` as described in its
      doc. These parameters can be passed using ``solver_kwargs`` below.
    solver_kwargs: keyword arguments passed on to the solver.
    symmetric: flag used to figure out whether the linear system solved in the
      implicit function theorem is symmetric or not. This happens when
      ``tau_a==tau_b``, and when ``a == b``, or the precondition_fun
      is the identity. The flag is False by default, and is also tested against
      ``tau_a==tau_b``. It needs to be set manually by the user in the more
      favorable case where the system is guaranteed to be symmetric.
    precondition_fun: Function used to precondition, on both sides, the linear
      system derived from first-order conditions of the regularized OT problem.
      That linear system typically involves an equality between marginals (or
      simple transform of these marginals when the problem is unbalanced) and
      another function of the potentials. When that function is specified, that
      function is applied on both sides of the equality, before being further
      differentiated to provide the Jacobians needed for implicit function
      theorem differentiation.

    r"""Apply minus inverse of [hessian ``reg_ot_cost`` w.r.t. ``f``, ``g``].

    This function is used to carry out implicit differentiation of ``sinkhorn``
    outputs, notably optimal potentials ``f`` and ``g``. That differentiation
    requires solving a linear system, using (and inverting) the Jacobian of
    (preconditioned) first-order conditions w.r.t. the reg-OT problem.

    Given a ``precondition_fun``, written here for short as :math:`h`,
    the first order conditions for the dual energy

    .. math::

      E(K, \epsilon, a, b, f, g) :=- <a,\phi_a^{*}(-f)> + <b,
      \phi_b^{*}(-g)> - \langle\exp^{f/\epsilon}, K \exp^{g/\epsilon}>

    form the basis of the Sinkhorn algorithm. To differentiate optimal solutions
    to that problem, we exploit the fact that :math:`h(\nabla E = 0)` and
    differentiate that identity to recover variations (Jacobians) of optimal
    solutions :math:`f^\star, g^\star$` as a function of changes in the inputs.
    The Jacobian of :math:`h(\nabla_{f,g} E = 0)` is a linear operator which, if
    it were to be instantiated as a matrix, would be of size
    :math:`(n+m) \times (n+m)`. When :math:`h` is the identity, that matrix is
    the Hessian of :math:`E`, is symmetric and negative-definite
    (:math:`E` is concave) and is structured as :math:`[A, B; B^T, D]`. More
    generally, for other functions :math:`h`, the Jacobian of these
    preconditioned
    first order conditions is no longer symmetric (except if ``a==b``), and
    has now a structure as :math:`[A, B; C, D]`. That system can
    be still inverted more generic solvers. By default, :math:`h = \epsilon
    \log`, as proposed in :cite:`cuturi:20a`.

    In both cases :math:`A` and :math:`D` are diagonal matrices, equal to the
    row and
    column marginals respectively, multiplied by the derivatives of :math:`h`
    evaluated at those marginals, corrected (if handling the unbalanced case)
    by the second derivative of the part of the objective that ties potentials
    to the marginals (terms in ``phi_star``). When :math:`h` is the identity,
    :math:`B` and :math:`B^T` are equal respectively to the OT matrix and its
    transpose, i.e. :math:`n \times m` and :math:`m \times n` matrices.
    When :math:`h` is not the identity, :math:`B` (resp. :math:`C`) is equal
    to the OT matrix (resp. its transpose), rescaled on the left by the
    application elementwise of :math:`h'` to the row (respectively column)
    marginal sum of the transport.

    Note that we take great care in not instantiating these transport
    matrices, to rely instead on calls to the ``app_transport`` method from the
    ``Geometry`` object ``geom`` (which will either use potentials or scalings,
    depending on ``lse_mode``)

    The Jacobian's diagonal + off-diagonal blocks structure allows to exploit
    Schur complements. Depending on the sizes involved, it is better to
    instantiate the Schur complement of the first or of the second diagonal
    block.

    These linear systems are solved using the user-defined ``solver``, using
    by default :mod:`lineax` solvers when available, or falling back on
    :mod:`jax` when not.

    Args:
      gr: 2-tuple, (vector of size ``n``, vector of size ``m``).
      ot_prob: the instantiation of the regularized transport problem.
      f: potential, w.r.t marginal a.
