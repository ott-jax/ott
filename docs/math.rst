ott.math
========
.. currentmodule:: ott.math
.. automodule:: ott.math

The :mod:`ott.math` module holds low level computational primitives that
appear in some more advanced optimal transport problems.
:mod:`ott.math.fixed_point_loop` implements a fixed-point iteration `while` loop
that can be automatically differentiated, and which might
be of more general interest to other `JAX` users.
:mod:`ott.math.matrix_square_root` contains an implementation of the
matrix square-root using the Newton-Schulz iterations. That implementation is
itself differentiable using either implicit differentiation or unrolling of the
updates of these iterations.
:mod:`ott.math.utils` contains various low-level routines re-implemented for
their usage in `JAX`. Of particular interest are the custom jvp/vjp
re-implementations for `logsumexp` and `norm` that have a behavior that differs,
in terms of differentiability, from the standard `JAX` implementations.
