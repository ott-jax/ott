    "# Grid Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "The {class}`~ott.geometry.grid.Grid` geometry was designed having in mind the many applications that use the so-called Eulerian description of probability measures. In such applications, probability measures are seen as histograms supported on a $d$-dimensional Cartesian grid, and not as point clouds.\n",
    "\n",
    "A {class}`~ott.geometry.grid.Grid` geometry instantiates a Cartesian product of $d$ lists of values, each list of index $i$ being of size $n_i$. That Cartesian product has a total number of $N:=\\prod_i n_i$ possible locations in $\\mathbb{R}^d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A {class}`~ott.geometry.grid.Grid` geometry also assumes that the ground cost between points in the grid is *separable*: For two points $x, y$ in that grid, the cost must be of the form $\\text{cost}(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^d \\text{cost}_i(x_i, y_i)$ where $\\text{cost}_i: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. As a result, a $d$-dimensional {class}`~ott.geometry.grid.Grid` expects a tuple of up to $d$ A {class}`~ott.geometry.costs.CostFn` objects, each describing a cost between two real-values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The advantage of using {class}`~ott.geometry.grid.Grid` over {class}`~ott.geometry.pointcloud.PointCloud` is that fundamental operations, such as applying the $N\\times N$ square cost matrix of all pairwise distances between the $N$ points in the grid, as well as its *kernel*, can be efficiently carried out in $O(N^{(1+1/d)})$ operations, with a similar memory footprint, rather than instantiating naively those matrices as $N^2$ blocks."

The resulting grid is the Cartesian product of these vectors (seen each as a list of values), namely $\\{u\\in x_1\\}\\times \\{u\\in x_2,\\} \\times \\{u\\in x_3\\}$. Assuming each vector is formed with distinct coordinates, that Cartesian product holds $N = n_1 n_2 n_3 = 5 \\times 6 \\times 7 = 210$ distinct points in the example below. `a` and `b` are two histograms on that grid, namely probability vectors of size $N$. Note that, to showcase the versatility of the {class}`~ott.geometry.grid.Grid` API, the grid is here is irregularly spaced, since locations along each dimension are random."
