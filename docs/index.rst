Optimal Transport Tools (OTT) documentation
===========================================

`Code <https://github.com/ott-jax/ott>`_ hosted on Github. To install,
clone that repo or simply run ``pip install ott-jax``.

Intro
-----
OTT is a `JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ package that bundles a few utilities to compute and differentiate the
solution to optimal transport problems. OTT can help you compute Wasserstein distances between
weighted clouds of points (or histograms), using a cost (e.g. a distance) between individual points.

To that end OTT uses a sturdy and versatile implementation of
the Sinkhorn algorithm [#]_ [#]_. This implementation takes advantage of several
JAX features, such as `Just-in-time (JIT) compilation <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html?highlight=jit#just-in-time-compilation-jit>`_,
`auto-vectorization (VMAP) <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html?highlight=jit#jax.vmap>`_, and
both `automatic <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html?highlight=jit#automatic-differentiation>`_
and/or `implicit <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html?highlight=jit#jax.custom_vjp>`_
differentiation. Basic tutorial snippets are provided below, along with a more advanced example to process single-cell genomics data [#]_.

Packages
--------


There are currently three packages, ``geometry``, ``core`` and ``tools``, playing the following roles:

- ``geometry`` defines classes that describe *two point clouds* paired with a *cost* function (simpler geometries are also implemented, such as that defined by points supported on a multi-dimensional grids with a separable cost [#]_).
  A geometry, along with weight vectors ``a`` and ``b``, describes an OT problem. ``core`` algorithms can solve such problems, using subroutines provided by geometries;
- ``core`` contains the Sinkhorn algorithm, the main workhorse to solve OT in this package, as well as variants that can be used to compute barycenters of several measures;
- ``tools`` provides an interface to exploit OT solutions, as produced by ``core`` functions. Such tasks include instantiating OT matrices, computing approximations to Wasserstein distances [#]_ [#]_, or computing differentiable sort and quantile operations [#]_.
