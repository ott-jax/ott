Optimal Transport Tools (OTT)
=============================

Introduction
------------
``OTT`` is a `JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ package that bundles a few utilities to compute,
and differentiate as needed, the solution to optimal transport (OT) problems, taken in a fairly wide sense.
For instance, ``OTT`` can of course compute Wasserstein (or Gromov-Wasserstein) distances between
weighted clouds of points (or histograms) in a wide variety of scenarios,
but also estimate Monge maps, Wasserstein barycenters, and help with simpler tasks
such as differentiable approximations to ranking or even clustering.

To achieve this, ``OTT`` rests on two families of tools:
The first family consists in *discrete* solvers computing transport between point clouds,
using the Sinkhorn :cite:`cuturi:13` and low-rank Sinkhorn :cite:`scetbon:21` algorithms,
and moving up towards Gromov-Wasserstein :cite:`memoli:11,peyre:16`;
the second family consists in *continuous* solvers, using suitable neural architectures :cite:`amos:17` coupled
with SGD type estimators :cite:`makkuva:20,korotin:21`.

Installation
------------
Install ``OTT`` from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/ott-jax/>`_ as:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ott-jax

or with ``conda`` via `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ott-jax>`_ as:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge ott-jax

Design Choices
--------------
``OTT`` is designed with the following choices:

- Take advantage whenever possible of JAX features, such as `Just-in-time (JIT) compilation`_,
  `auto-vectorization (VMAP)`_ and both `automatic`_ but most importantly `implicit`_ differentiation.
- Split geometry from OT solvers in the discrete case: We argue that there
  should be one, and one implementation only, of every major OT algorithm
  (Sinkhorn, Gromov-Wasserstein, barycenters, etc...), regardless of the
  geometric setup that is considered. To give a concrete example, any
  speedups one may benefit from by using a specific cost
  (e.g. Sinkhorn being faster when run on a separable cost on histograms supported
  on a separable grid :cite:`solomon:15`) should not require a separate
  reimplementation of a Sinkhorn routine.
- As a consequence, and to minimize code copy/pasting, use as often as possible
  object hierarchies, and interleave outer solvers (such as quadratic,
  aka Gromov-Wasserstein solvers) with inner solvers (e.g. Low-Rank Sinkhorn).
  This choice ensures that speedups achieved at lower computation levels
  (e.g. low-rank factorization of squared Euclidean distances) propagate seamlessly and
  automatically in higher level calls (e.g. updates in Gromov-Wasserstein),
  without requiring any attention from the user.

Packages
--------
- :ref:`geometry` contains classes to instantiate objects that describe
  *two point clouds* paired with a *cost* function. Geometry objects are used to
  describe OT problems, handled by solvers in the :ref:`solvers`.
- :ref:`problems`
- :ref:`solvers`
- :ref:`initializers`
- :ref:`tools` provides an interface to exploit OT solutions, as produced by
  solvers in the :ref:`solvers`. Such tasks include computing approximations
  to Wasserstein distances :cite:`genevay:18,sejourne:19`, approximating OT
  between GMMs, or computing differentiable sort and quantile operations
  :cite:`cuturi:19`.
- :ref:`math`
