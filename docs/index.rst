Optimal Transport Tools (OTT)
=============================

Introduction
------------
``OTT`` is a `JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ package that bundles
a few utilities to compute, and differentiate as needed, the solution to optimal
transport (OT) problems, taken in a fairly wide sense. For instance, ``OTT`` can
of course compute Wasserstein (or Gromov-Wasserstein) distances between weighted
clouds of points (or histograms) in a wide variety of scenarios, but also
estimate Monge maps, Wasserstein barycenters, and help with simpler tasks such
as differentiable approximations to ranking or even clustering.

To achieve this, ``OTT`` rests on two families of tools:

- the first family consists in *discrete* solvers computing transport between
  point clouds, using the Sinkhorn :cite:`cuturi:13` and low-rank Sinkhorn
  :cite:`scetbon:21` algorithms, and moving up towards Gromov-Wasserstein
  :cite:`memoli:11,peyre:16`;
- the second family consists in *continuous* solvers, using suitable neural
  architectures such as an MLP or input-convex neural network
  :cite:`amos:17` coupled with SGD-like estimators
  :cite:`makkuva:20,korotin:21,amos:23`.

Installation
------------
Install ``OTT`` from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/ott-jax/>`_ as:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ott-jax

or with ``conda`` via `conda-forge`_ as:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge ott-jax

Design Choices
--------------
``OTT`` is designed with the following choices:

- Take advantage whenever possible of JAX features, such as
  `just-in-time (JIT) compilation`_, `auto-vectorization (VMAP)`_ and both
  `automatic`_ but most importantly `implicit`_ differentiation.
- Split geometry from OT solvers in the discrete case: We argue that there
  should be one, and one implementation only, of every major OT algorithm
  (Sinkhorn, Gromov-Wasserstein, barycenters, etc...), regardless of the
  geometric setup that is considered. To give a concrete example, any
  speedups one may benefit from by using a specific cost (e.g. Sinkhorn being
  faster when run on a separable cost on histograms supported on a separable
  grid :cite:`solomon:15`) should not require a separate reimplementation
  of a Sinkhorn routine.
- As a consequence, and to minimize code copy/pasting, use as often as possible
  object hierarchies, and interleave outer solvers (such as quadratic,
  aka Gromov-Wasserstein solvers) with inner solvers (e.g., low-rank Sinkhorn).
  This choice ensures that speedups achieved at lower computation levels
  (e.g. low-rank factorization of squared Euclidean distances) propagate
  seamlessly and automatically in higher level calls (e.g. updates in
  Gromov-Wasserstein), without requiring any attention from the user.

Packages
--------
.. module:: ott

- :mod:`ott.geometry` contains classes that instantiate the ground *cost matrix*
  used to specify OT problems. Here cost matrix can be understood in
  a literal (by actually passing a matrix) or abstract sense (by passing
  information that is sufficient to recreate that matrix, apply all or parts
  of it, or apply its kernel). A typical example in the latter case arises
  when comparing *two point clouds*, paired with a *cost function*. Geometry
  objects are used to describe OT *problems*, solved next by *solvers*.
- :mod:`ott.problems` are used to describe linear, quadratic or barycenter OT
  problems.
- :mod:`ott.solvers` solve a problem instantiated with :mod:`ott.problems` using
  one of the implemented techniques.
- :mod:`ott.initializers` implement simple strategies to initialize solvers.
  When the problems are solved with a convex solver, such as a
  :class:`~ott.problems.linear.linear_problem.LinearProblem` solved with a
  :class:`~ott.solvers.linear.sinkhorn.Sinkhorn` solver, the resolution of OT
  solvers, then this initialization is mostly useful to speed up convergences.
  When the problem is *not* convex, which is the case for most other uses of
  this toolbox, the initialization can play a decisive role to reach a useful
  solution.
- :mod:`ott.tools` provides an interface to exploit OT solutions, as produced by
  solvers from the :mod:`ott.solvers` module. Such tasks include computing
  approximations to Wasserstein distances :cite:`genevay:18,sejourne:19`,
  approximating OT between GMMs, or computing differentiable sort and quantile
  operations :cite:`cuturi:19`.
- :mod:`ott.math` holds low-level miscellaneous mathematical primitives, such as
  an implementation of the matrix square-root.
- :mod:`ott.utils` provides miscellaneous helper functions.
