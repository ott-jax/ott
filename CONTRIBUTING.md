# Contributing to OTT

We'd love to accept your contributions to this project.

There are many ways to contribute to OTT, with the most common ones being contribution of code, documentation
to the project, participating in discussions or raising issues.

## Contributing code or documentation
1. fork the repository using the **Fork** button on GitHub or the following
   [link](https://github.com/ott-jax/ott/fork)
2. ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ott
   cd ott
   pip install -e .'[dev,test]'
   pre-commit install
   ```

When committing changes, sometimes you might want or need to bypass the pre-commit checks. This can be
done via the ``--no-verify`` flag as:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "The commit message"
```

## Running tests
In order to run tests, you can:
```bash
pytest  # run all tests
pytest -m fast  # run only fast tests
pytest tests/core/sinkhorn_test.py  # only test within a specific file
pytest -k "test_euclidean_point_cloud"  # only tests which contain the expression
```

In order to run memory related tests (used for low-rank solvers/geometries and online point clouds), we utilize
[pytest-memray](https://github.com/bloomberg/pytest-memray) (current available only on Linux).
Whenever running the ``pytest`` commands mentioned above, the ``--memray`` option needs to be specified as well.

Lastly, to the run notebook regression tests, use ``pytest -m notebook``. Cell execution limit can be adjusted
using ``--notebook-cell-timeout=...`` (in seconds), Jupyter kernel name can be set using ``--kernel-name=...``.

## Building documentation
From the root of the repository, run:
```bash
pip install -e.'[docs]'
cd docs
make html  # use `-j 4` to run using 4 jobs
<your favorite browser> _build/html/index.html
# run `make clean` to remove generated files
```
