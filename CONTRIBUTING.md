# Contributing to OTT

We'd love to accept your contributions to this project.

There are many ways to contribute to OTT, with the most common ones being contribution of code, documentation
to the project, participating in discussions or raising issues.

## Contributing code or documentation
1. fork the repository using the **Fork** button on GitHub or the following
   [link](https://github.com/ott-jax/ott/fork)

```

## Running tests
In order to run tests, you can:
```bash
pytest  # uses all cores by default
pytest tests/sinkhorn_test.py  # only test within a specific file
pytest -k "test_euclidean_point_cloud"  # only tests which contain the expression
```

## Building documentation
From the root of the repository, run:
```bash
pip install -e.'[docs]'
cd docs
make html  # use `-j 4` to run using 4 jobs

# run `make clean` to remove generated files
```
